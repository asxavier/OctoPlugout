"unplugged",

# PlugOut: an electrical plug Made from a "sonoff" device by reflashing the firmware that is:
#- WiFi connected: not wired through eg. GPIO
#- OctoPrint aware, but not a plugin: a PlugOut!
#
# Triger evaluation order:
# - press: short (SP) and long (LP)
# - WiFi: Down (Wifi-) and up (Wifi+)
# - Pi:  Down (Pi-) / Alive (Pi+)
# - Print state: Printing (Print+) / Not Printing (Print-)
# - Extruder Temperature:  Hot (Temp+) / Cold (Temp-)
#
#use https://state-machine-cat.js.org/ to visualize these lines and see the states.
